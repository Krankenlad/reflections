What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git vs having versions automatically saved like Google Docs does?

Pros are you get to decide when they happen, so that you have control
You can make sure they are committed at logical times, not in the middle of something

Cons are could forget to commit changes, or have too few commits to describe the changes accurately
